# SnakeAndLadderGame
### Step by Step
# Create the Game Board
We'll define the snakes and ladders as maps where keys are the start points, and values are the endpoints.
# Player Mode
The player rolls a dice (random number from 1 to 6) and moves on the board. If the player lands on a snake or ladder, their position is updated accordingly. The game continues until the player reaches position 100.
# Admin Mode
The admin can add, update, or delete snakes and ladders and then play the game like a player. The game should reflect the updated board.
